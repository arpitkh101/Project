# Discovery of Innovative Knowledge through Optimization and Machine Learning.

## Objective
- The overall objective is to develop a multi-objective optimization algorithim which could be applied on real world problems.
- This project aims to develop a model which could learn to improve the existing location of a point in 30 dimensional space over different generations for a continuous distribution of points.

## Test Problem
 There are various problems available on the [pymoo](https://pymoo.org/problems/index.html) framework for testing. 

## Description
Many models were tested using catboostregressor, SVRs, decision tree ensemble methods including random forests, gradient boost and xgboost  in different hyperparameter settings. After testing models on different problems it was observed that random forest was giving appreciable results as compared to the original model.
